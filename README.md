# INFINITY
## Motivation
The night skyâ€™s variables are immensely diverse where they are constantly changing. However, such variations are very small and tiny for the humans to observe while looking up in the night sky with their naked eye. So, we came up with INFINITY. INFINITY simulates the space and stars along with planetary physics using various physics functions. These simulations include the periodic change of brightness, lifespan, and rate of (change) of the star. This feature allows us to create an educational tool to teach the user about stellar variability via simulation, which allows us to amplify the star brightness variability making it more detectable and accessible.
